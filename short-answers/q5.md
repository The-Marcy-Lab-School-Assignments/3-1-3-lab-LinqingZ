Good start! You’ve touched on an important concept, but it’s crucial to be more specific. The main danger is not just about visibility, but about security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This happens when malicious users inject scripts into the DOM, which can lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or even full control over a website. Try to expand on the specific risks of unescaped content and how it opens the door to these attacks.

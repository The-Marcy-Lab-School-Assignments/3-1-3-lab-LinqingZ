# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer
1. Scope Encapsulation: Using <script type="module"> ensures that the code inside index.js runs in its own scope. This means variables or functions declared in the module won't pollute the global scope, reducing the risk of naming conflicts. 

2. Modules allow the use of ES6 import and export syntax, enabling more structured and maintainable codebases. This makes it easier to break down code into smaller, reusable components.

Nailed it! Your point on scope encapsulation and the ability to use ES6 import/export syntax is spot on. To make your response even better, you could also mention how module scripts are deferred by default, which can improve page load performance by not blocking the rendering process.

# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
Using semantic elements means utilizing HTML tags that convey the meaning of the content they enclose, not just its appearance. These elements clearly describe their purpose and the type of content they hold to both the browser and the developer, improving accessibility and search engine optimization.

Example of a semantic element: <article> - This tag specifies independent, self-contained content. It could be used for a blog post, a news article, or a user comment.

Example of a non-semantic element: <div> - This tag has no meaning and is used purely for styling or as a container for other elements without conveying any information about its contents.
